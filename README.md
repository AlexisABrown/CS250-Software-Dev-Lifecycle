# CS250-Software-Dev-Lifecycle
Files from my CS250 course on the software development lifecycle. Below are reflections from the course. 

It can be hard to understand and orgainize user needs. Needs can be vague, or even conflict with each other. To combat
this agile requires communcation with stakeholders throughout the project. The development team is expected to share 
working product regularly. This ensures the requirments set in the user stories(short descriptions of a
single product feature) are met. 

Like many other developers, I am guilty of planning too much too soon. At my current job it is expected to have a heavy amount of 
documentation before starting a project. This has made it difficult to get new initiatives off the ground. The idea of priortizing 
a working product first is one I plan to share with my team. Even though it will take time to shift this mindset, I know I can 
communicate the benfits. 

Scrum doesn't work without communication. It's even more important that it's clear communication. We should strive
to be transparent with our team about questions, challenges, and concerns. Many team members new to agile can be reluctant to share issues,
fearing judgement. As a team member I can help demostrate good communication by sharing my own work. This will demonstrate 
to others that they should do the same.
